- dotnet webapi host: http://localhost:5238
- next.js react host: http://localhost:3000

RUN BACKEND (from the apphost project):  dotnet run 
RUN FRONTEND: npm run dev

basic project structure for future reference:
- There are 3 different asp dotnet projects in the backend that work with each other
- apphost is the centeral hub of sorts, where it is able to host packages like postgresql and able to allow webapi to access it
- service defaults does alot of the maintence from what I can understand?

- dashboard causes a single error where it fails to connect to an already used port
- this error leads to many other errors (not fatal for now).

- aspire dotnet allows for indirect sql querying through C# function, but does allow raw SQL commands: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/sql-queries?tabs=sqlserver

TOMORROW:
- must follow dotnet tutorial for sql connections.
