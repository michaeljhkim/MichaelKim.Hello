- dotnet webapi host: http://localhost:5238
- next.js react host: http://localhost:3000

RUN BACKEND (from the apphost project):  dotnet run 
RUN FRONTEND: npm run dev

basic project structure for future reference:
- There are 3 different asp dotnet projects in the backend that work with each other
- apphost is the centeral hub of sorts, where it is able to host packages like postgresql and able to allow webapi to access it
- service defaults does alot of the maintence from what I can understand?
