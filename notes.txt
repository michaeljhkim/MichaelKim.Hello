- dotnet webapi host: http://localhost:5431
- next.js react host: http://localhost:3000

RUN BACKEND (from the apphost project):  dotnet run dev
RUN FRONTEND: npm run dev


- dashboard causes a single error where it fails to connect to an already used port
- this error leads to many other errors (not fatal for now).

- aspire dotnet allows for indirect sql querying through C# function, but does allow raw SQL commands: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/sql-queries?tabs=sqlserver
- create a .env file or something that dotnet adds it's port to, and allow react to read from that file

- always run the react side from host when developing, dashboard does not update until next run
- run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' if the certificates are not authenticating properly

- in order to shorten the terminal prompt to just the current folder name, go into bashrc, find this line:
    PS1="${userpart} ${lightblue}\W ${gitbranch}${removecolor}\$ "
- and modify \w to \W
- \w is for the full file path, \W is for just the current folder 

- when testing and retrying dev container building, restart docker:
sudo systemctl restart docker
- this fixes the issues immediately
