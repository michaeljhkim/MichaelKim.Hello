- dotnet webapi host: http://localhost:5431
- next.js react host: http://localhost:3000

RUN BACKEND (from the apphost project):  dotnet run dev
RUN FRONTEND: npm run dev


- dashboard causes a single error where it fails to connect to an already used port
- this error leads to many other errors (not fatal for now).

- aspire dotnet allows for indirect sql querying through C# function, but does allow raw SQL commands: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/sql-queries?tabs=sqlserver
- create a .env file or something that dotnet adds it's port to, and allow react to read from that file

- in order to properly host sql and such locally, the dev container MUST have the following: "runArgs": ["--network", "host"]
- this allows for host network passthrough

- always run the react side from host when developing, dashboard does not update until clean rebuild
