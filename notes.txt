REMEMBER:
- must login to azure before doing anything:
    az login

- 'azd init' in the backend folder
- 'dotnet publish' in apiservice folder
- deploy the resulting publish folder. Its in '/bin/Release/net9.0' (right-click for ease of use)
- CLI: 
    az webapp deploy --resource-group michaelkim-hello --name michaelkim-hello-backend-apiservice --src-path ./bin/Release/net9.0/publish


TOMORROW:
- Since the personal website showcases web skills, perhaps I should make HelixWatt just a local app.
- Add screenshots to all project githubs (including the personal website), in addition to adding them to the personal website

- Finish with details of personal website (except for HelixWatt)
- Host the frontend on Azure if possible; If not, host on vercel
